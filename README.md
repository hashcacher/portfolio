## To Do
![alt tag](docs/plan.jpg)

###### D3
Hide empty years
Choose how many companies
Closing circles - release memory
Clicking game - zoom

###### Preprocessing
Group the makers by connectedness

Cleanup
* Ubi Soft = Ubisoft
* Some rows are split into 2 lines

###### Joining more data
* Metacritic
* Maker revenue
* Images

## Data
```javascript
{
	"maker1": [
				3,
				["game1", "1998", "N64"],
				["game2", "1998", "PS4"]
				["game3", "1998", "Sega Genesis"]
			]
	"maker2": [
				1,
				["game1", "1988", "Atari"],
			]
}
```
