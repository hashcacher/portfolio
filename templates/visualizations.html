		         I made a genome evolution visualization at VIDI Labs with Chris Bryan and <a href'http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma/'>Dr. Kwan Liu Ma</a>. I started the project a year ago and maintain it to this day.

		        Our Java application is a novel presentation of evolution on the chromosomal level to novice users. I co-authored a paper that was accepted to the <a href="http://ieeevis.org/attachments/vis16-program-final.pdf">IEEE SciVis</a> conference to share our work.
		        </p>
		        <p>
		         The visualization shows how chromosomes rearrange, mutate and form new species by using animation and color. The visualization reads both genomic as well as phylogenetic tree data. As more data becomes available, our visualization will become more and more rich, since new data is easy to add.
